## About Me

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at [L'Institut de Recherche Dupuy de Lome (IRDL), UMR CNRS 6027](https://www.irdl.fr/), University of Brest, France, working with [Prof. Mohamed Benbouzid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WhrSVDkAAAAJ).

My research focuses on developing advanced machine learning and deep learning models for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of lithium-ion batteries, including Transformer, Mamba, TCN, (Bi)LSTM, (Bi)GRU, and Generative AI for time-series forecasting.
