## About Me

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at [L'Institut de Recherche Dupuy de Lome (IRDL), UMR CNRS 6027](https://www.irdl.fr/), University of Brest, France, working with [Prof. Mohamed Benbouzid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WhrSVDkAAAAJ).

My research focuses on developing advanced machine learning and deep learning models for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of lithium-ion batteries, including Transformer, Mamba, TCN, (Bi)LSTM, (Bi)GRU, and Generative AI for time-series forecasting.

## Research Interests

- **AI & Deep Learning**: Deep learning for time-series forecasting; transfer learning and foundation models (TimeGPT, TimesFM)
- **Efficient Fine-tuning**: LoRA-based adaptation of foundation models for domain-specific time-series forecasting
- **Probabilistic Forecasting & Uncertainty Quantification**: Quantile regression, prediction intervals, calibration, CRPS / pinball loss
- **Online Adaptation & Regime-Aware Modeling**: Two-stage forecasting (offline baseline + online window correction), concept drift handling; Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing
- **Signal Processing & Feature Engineering**: VMD/OVMD, EMD/CEEMDAN; feature fusion, correlation analysis; dimensionality reduction
- **Digital Twins & Prognostics**: Health indicator extraction, RUL prediction, fault diagnosis; data-driven digital twin pipelines
